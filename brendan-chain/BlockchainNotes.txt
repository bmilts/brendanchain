BLOCKHASHES AND SHA-256

- What is hash algorithm?
- A cryptographic hash function is a hash function that takes an input or message and returns a fixed size alphanumeric string
- The string is called the hash value, message digest, digital fingerprint, digest or checksum

- The hash is generated from the timestamp, lasthash and stored data
- SHA256 algorithm produces a unique 256 bit hash value for unique data inputs
- One way hash
- Useful for block validation

Summary:

1. As mineblock is called
2. Hash value is created based on timestamp

TEST THE BLOCK

- Set up environment testing environment using jest module

Summary:

1. Test shows data appears properly
2. Test shows hash appears properly

BLOCKCHAIN CLASS

- Block chain is an array of blocks
- new block created based on last block to create links

MULTIPLE CHAIN VALIDATION (HASH VALIDATION)

- In order for miners to accept chains there needs to be validation
- Forks resolved in the chain
1. Miner A and B create a fork in the system
2. Half miners have chains from miner A and B
3. Which chains do miners agree to?
4. Miners accept longest chain. 

HASH VALIDATION 

- Support multiple miners
